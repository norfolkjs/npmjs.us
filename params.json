This service is sponsored and maintained by [norfolkjs.org](norfolkjs.org).\r\n\r\n### Using this service\r\n- Option 1: Add this registry to your `.npmrc`. e.g.\r\n\r\n        registry = https://registry.npmjs.us/public\r\n\r\n- Option 2: Set the registry config via `npm`\r\n\r\n        npm config set registry=https://registry.npmjs.us/public\r\n\r\n- Option 2: Add it as a command-line argument\r\n\r\n        npm install <module> --registry https://registry.npmjs.us/public\r\n\r\n### Modus Operandi\r\nWe continuously replicate the official npmjs database. It is large, so updates \r\nto public npm modules may take some minutes to show up in our registry.\r\nThe public database is read-only, so do not try to publish to it. In the event\r\nof failure to resolve a module, the server will failover to the official npm\r\nservice. This service is SSL-secured and monitored.\r\n\r\n### Issues?\r\nIf you have questions, comments, or notice issues with this service, please file\r\nan issue here: <https://github.com/norfolkjs/npmjs.us>.\r\n\r\n\r\n1CTs5sGpaXNhvjL5B4my1EmHLoK5TPqrPT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
